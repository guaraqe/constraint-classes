#+TITLE: constraint-classes

This package implements some classes using ~ConstraintKinds~ in a way
that is supposed to not clash with the standard ones. The rule is that
class ~Something~ becomes ~CSomething~.

Currently the implemented classes are:
- ~Functor~
- ~Foldable~

I use them mainly for ~Storable~, so that ~Applicative~ and ~Monad~ in
their standard forms are not implementable, which explain their
absence here, but PR are welcome.
